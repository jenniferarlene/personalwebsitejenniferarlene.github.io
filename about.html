                <p>Hello Everyone! My name is Jennifer Arlene Kurniawan, My friends usually call me Jen or J.A.. 
                    I was born on December 22nd 2003 at the capital city of Indonesia, Jakarta. 
                    I was also born and raised in Jakarta. But, at the end of fourth grade, me and my family had to move to Tangerang because of my father's job. 
                    Therefore, I had to adapt to the new environment, also finding new friends. At first, i had trouble communicating with new people. 
                    Even in my new school, I fell asleep in class because of the teacher's teaching methods are way too different from my old school. 
                    But at the end, I managed to follow the studying methods and found some good and caring friends. 
                    I continued junior and senior high school at the same school and now, 
                    I'm a first grade student at Multimedia Nusantara University majoring in Information Technology, 21st generation.</p>
